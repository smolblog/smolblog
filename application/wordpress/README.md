# Smolblog for WordPress

I’d just like to interject for a moment. What you’re refering to as Smolblog, is in fact,
WordPress/Smolblog, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, WordPress plus Smolblog.
Smolblog is not a blog platform unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully
functioning WordPress system made useful by the WordPress core functionality, database
utilities and vital system components comprising a full platform as defined by bloggers
everywhere.
