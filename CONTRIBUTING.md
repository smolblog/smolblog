## About Pull Requests

Pull request templates are coming soon, but the basic idea is

1. Run the fixer. Use your IDE or `composer lintfix`.
2. Run the linter. Use your IDE or `composer lint`.
3. Write tests for new code.
4. Make sure tests for existing code pass. Only change those tests if there is a change in those classes, and then very carefully.

## About Copyright

We are not currently asking for copyright assignment, but we are asking for two rights:

1. To incorporate your work into the library and license it to the public under the AGPL 3.0, and
2. To incoprorate your work into the library and license it privately under a proprietary license, potentially for a fee to be collected by Evan Hildreth d/b/a Smolblog and used to fund the project and ensure interoperability.

Which is the fanciest way of saying "Smolblog will be dual-licensed under the AGPL or a commercial license." The intent of the commercial license would be to

1. fund the project and
2. ensure that derivative works and services maintain compatability with the greater Smolblog project while
3. clarifying the legal burden required by those using Smolblog in an environment where AGPL compliance is not desired or feasible.

If you have questions or concerns, please contact license@smolblog.com **before** submitting a pull request.

On behalf of the Smolblog project, we sincerely thank you for your contributions.
