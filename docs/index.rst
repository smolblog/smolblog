Smolblog\Core
=============

This is the core domain model for Smolblog. It's built with nods toward Domain Driven Design and uses as many SOLID principles as were feasable. Particular tenants:

1. Use Dependency Injection.
2. Use Interfaces when interacting with the outside framework.
3. Separate reads and writes.

More later.
